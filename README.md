MatrixStream C++ Engine

A real-time console animation engine built in C++ that simulates falling binary streams, inspired by the iconic "digital rain" effect from The Matrix films.

This project demonstrates low-level terminal control, timed rendering, and performance optimization for column-based animations.

Features

Real-time falling binary stream animation in the terminal

Multi-column support with independent speeds

Customizable characters and stream density

Lightweight, pure C++ implementation (no external libraries required)

Cross-platform support (tested on Windows, Linux, macOS terminals)

Demo


Click to see animation in action (if a video is available, you can link it here).

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/MulengaHankandaChituta/MatrixStream_c-_engine.git
cd MatrixStream_c-_engine

Compile the project using g++:

g++ -o MatrixStream main.cpp

Replace main.cpp with the actual source file names if different.

Run the program:

./MatrixStream

On Windows, use:

MatrixStream.exe
Usage

Launch the program in a terminal.

Watch the Matrix-style streams fall across the console.

Close the program with Ctrl+C or your terminal’s standard exit command.
